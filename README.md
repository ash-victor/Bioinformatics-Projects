# Useful Bioinformatic Analyses Scripts ðŸ§¬

This repository contains python scripts that do basic bioinformatic analyses such as: 
1. **Creating Consensus Sequences**: This program will create a consensus sequence, which represents the most frequent nucleotide at each position in an alignment of two or more sequences.
2. **Creating a Phylogenetic Tree using Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean**: 
This program will infer a phylogenetic tree usig WPGMA. WPGMA (Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) is a simple method of creating phylogenies. It creates phylogenies by pairing off sequences (or sequence groups) based on similarity, until a single group remains.
3. **Finding Degenerate Primers using Regex**
